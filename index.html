                                   I graduated from Olin College of Engineering in 2017 with a Mechanical Engineering degree and a concentration in robotics and medical device 
                                   design.  For the past three years I have been working at DEKA Research and Development in Manchester, NH.  My first job was working as a  Test
                                   Engineer for a home-base kidney dialysis system.  For the past two years, I have been working as a Mechanical Engineer designing
                                   the disposable for an insulin pump. I am especially interested in applying my mechanical and robotics skills to the medical device field. I 
                                   have always had an interest in trying to figure out how things work and come up with ways to make them better. Simplifying complex problems 
                                   in order to apply easy solutions is my passion.

                During 2018, we decided to build a pendulum wave sculpture to be displayed at DEKA. We designed the frame to emulate Manchester's Notre Dame Bridge, which was torn down in
                1989 despite Dean's efforts to convince the city to restore it.  The pendulums were designed such that after they were all released at once, they would oscillate different frequencies and grow out of sync. After exactly one minute,
                the pendulums would all line up again in the same position they started.  As an extra twist, we used counter-weights to reverse the relative frequencies of the pendulums such
                that the longer pendulums would oscillate faster than shorter ones.</p>

                the table to draw designs. Our table uses a delta drive system, which controls the positions of three vertical linear carriages.  These carriages move the magnet 
                controlling the ball bearing in three dimensions. The table was designed to be in the shape of a Reuleaux triangle in order to maximize the drawing space. We hid 
                the controls for the tables in the leg screws using capacitance sensors to keep the design sleek. New designs can be uploaded into Marlin control software for 
                custom drawings.</p>

              <p class="card-text">For my senior capstone project, I worked with a team of five students to develop a novel biopsy tool for use in Auris Health's robotic bronchoscope. 
                The tool was designed to be able to articulate laterally with respect to the bronchoscope, allowing the surgeon to take biopsies without having to aim the scope 
                directly at the target. We created the tool from the ground up, brainstorming many ideas and narrowing them down with increasingly higher fidelity prototypes. By 
                the end of the project, we created an articulating needle with three degrees of freedom (radial angle, lateral angle, and insertion depth) controlled by one hand 
                for ease of use. We created a functioning prototype that successfully collected a biopsy sample from a pig cadaver. We also designed a system for integrating our 
                tool into Auris' robotic bronchoscope.</p>

              <p class="card-text"> During the summer of 2016, I worked for Barret Medical on their therapeutic robotic arm. My job included conducting tolerance analysis, 
                creating drawings for inspection, and developing use cases of the device for FDA approval.  During the process, I also developed designs for the armrest 
                adjustment system to enhance patent comfort and built a fatigue tester that simulated two years of use in eighteen days.</p>

                Wind Powered Engine Sculpture
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">For my final Mechanical Design project, I worked in a team of four to design an interactive wind sculpture that displayed the inner workings 
                  of a boxer style six-cylinder engine.  The design is a bench in the shape of an engine block with a glass top, allowing people to sit on it and watch the inner
                  workings of the engine.  As the wind turbine spins, the engine components move, showing the steps of the auto cycle. There is also a transmission that mimics 
                  the car transmission and allows someone to shift gears, slowing down or speeding up the engine.</p>

                Pnuematic Robotic Shoulder Joint
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">I designed, built, and tested a pneumatically actuated shoulder joint. By using soft compressive elements rather than pistons or a McKibben 
                actuator, the size of the joint can be greatly reduced. The joint uses two pouches at opposite sides of the joint which are filled with air to apply a 
                compressive force. When air is added or released in each pouch, the two plates move relative to each other at an angle. An accelerometer gyroscope is used to 
                track the angle of the joint and a PID control system adjusts the air flow into each pouch until the desired angle is achieved. This joint has one degree of 
                freedom, but is designed to be easily modified for two.</p>

              <p class="card-text">This is the 2017 model of my Human Powered Vehicle team's recumbent tricycle for the Human Powered Vehicle Competition. Our designs ranged from
                a fully faired monocoque trike, where the carbon fiber shell acted as the main structural member, to an open steel frame trike (as shown above). Every year we 
                would design and build a new vehicle and enter the contest, coming in second place for design in 2016 and third place overall in 2014. For more information click

                Checkers Playing Robot
              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">Working with a team of 5 students, we designed and built a checkers playing robot for under $180. For our mechanical system, we used a three 
                axis gantry to navigate to the desired position and a universal gripper. The gripper utilized a process called jamming in which a balloon filled with coffee grounds 
                is pressed against and forms around an object. Excess air is then sucked out of the balloon causing the coffee grounds to pack around the object and grip it tightly. 
                We used a Raspberry Pi and OpenCV for image processing and an Arduino for motor control. For more information click
